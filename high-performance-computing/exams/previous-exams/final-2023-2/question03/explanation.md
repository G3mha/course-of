# Reasoning and Speedup

**Reasoning for Dividing Work with Threads:**

- The `nextGeneration` function was parallelized using `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)` to ensure that each thread processes a part of the grid, distributing the workload evenly among the threads.

**Comment on Speedup:**

- Speedup can be calculated by comparing the execution time of the serial version (single thread) with the parallel version (multiple threads). The execution time is expected to decrease as the number of threads increases. However, the performance gain may vary depending on the overhead of creating threads and the efficiency of the parallelization.
