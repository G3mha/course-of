## Regression Project

- Acquire data and do exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Pre-process data (clean, feature engineering)

- Separate between training and test sets

- Train and select models

- Final evaluation and conclusions

- Re-train and produce final model

- Monitor and maintain model

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Check if the data is correctly loaded

- Obtain information about the data (documentation)

- Check if the columns are correct:

  - Data types
  - Missing values
  - Simple descriptive statistics:
    - Continuous variables: mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quantiles
    - Categorical variables: frequency table, amount of categories

- Feature analysis:
  - Continuous variables: histograms, boxplots
  - Categorical variables: barplots
